Description
===========
This web app can be used for reviewing and rating packages for the Sublime Text Editor.

On the Sublime Editor homepage you find more than 2k packages, which can be downloaded and installed to improve your experience while working with the text editor. There you find information like the amount of unique installs and the ranking, which indicate the popularity of a certain package. Anyway, it does not show any personal feedback or rating by users. That is the purpose of this app. Here you can review and rate apps and share your evaluation with other users.

In an overview this app provides the following features:
- Login via twitter, facebook and directly at this website
- Search of sublime packages
- Display of each package's name, author, description, unique installs and rank (data retrieved from sublime editor website)
- Show/hide reviews for each package (newest reviews first)
- Write reviews AND rate packages (login required)
- Rating system from 1:poor to 5:excellent
- Visualization of rating through stars
- Delete function for reviews (login required, author-restricted)
- Visualization of packages by unique installs in a bubble chart, pie chart and bar chart
- Responsive design

To write a review you need to login. For testing purposes just click "LogIn" and log in as "user@test.com".
